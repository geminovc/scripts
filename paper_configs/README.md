## Paper configs
These configs are used for training and inference of different model structures. `fom_standard` refers to the original [FOM](https://aliaksandrsiarohin.github.io/first-order-model-website/) structure. `only_upsample_blocks` refers to a model structure with added upsampling blocks at the end of the FOM structure to bring up the resolution. `with_hr_skip_connections` refers to a model structure with downsample blocks before the FOM structure to bring down the image resolution to 256 and then upsampling blocks at the end of the FOM structure; moreover, the model has skip connections between downsampling and upsampling layers. `without_hr_skip_connections` is essentially the same as `with_hr_skip_connections` but without the skip connections
